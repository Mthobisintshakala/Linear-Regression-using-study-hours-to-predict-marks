# ðŸŽ“ Student Marks Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how **Simple Linear Regression** can be used to predict a student's exam score based on the number of hours they studied. The model was built and trained using Python, with performance evaluated using the RÂ² score.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

To develop a linear regression model that predicts **student marks** based on the **number of hours** they spend studying.

---

## ðŸ§¾ Dataset Features

- `Hours` â€“ Number of hours a student studied  
- `Scores` â€“ Marks obtained by the student

---

## ðŸ§  Model Overview

- Model Used: `LinearRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model`
- Evaluation Metric: **RÂ² score**
- Model Accuracy: **Approximately 70% (0.70 RÂ² score)**

This indicates that **70% of the variation in marks** can be explained by the number of hours studied â€” making it a reasonably accurate model.

The graph below shows the modelâ€™s prediction results using the testing dataset.

- The **cyan triangles** represent the original test values (actual student marks).
- The **red line** represents the predicted values from the linear regression model.
- The photo above shows the actual vs predicted results and demonstrates the effectiveness of the model on testing data.
